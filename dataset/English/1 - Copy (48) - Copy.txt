One paper says, “Moreover, AI elements provide high computational power, which simulates authentic environments (e.g., plant and animal growth as time passes) and acts like humans as non-player characters” (Ng, Davy Tsz Kit, et al. 4). AI can not only process information into text form, but it can also synthesize it visually. This can make it much easier for students to learn material, while also relieving the teachers of much of the hard work required to make simulations or experiments. AI is also capable of acting as agents for students to interact with. These agents can be virtual tutors, peers, or even experts that the students operate with to expand and express their knowledge. AI excels at integrating information into different formats, many of which help students learn that information.
