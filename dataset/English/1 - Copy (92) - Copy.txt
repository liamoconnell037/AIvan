RYDER MANUALLY RELEASES THE ELEVATOR CABLES TO QUICKLY LOWER HUMDINGER AND HIS KITTENS TO THE GROUND, AND THEN STARTS RAPPELLING DOWN THE SHAFT, BUT THE TOWER GETS BLOWN OVER SIDEWAYS AND RYDER GETS TRAPPED. HAVING SEEN THE TOWER FALL, CHASE RUSHES TO RESCUE HIM BY USING SUCTION-CUPPED TIRES ON HIS CAR'S DETACHABLE MOTORCYCLE TO RIDE STRAIGHT UP THE SIDE OF THE WINDOWS.
