The New York City Department of Education banned any use of ChatGPT in schools in 2023, just months after its initial release date. The department concluded that ChatGPT could hinder studentsâ€™ education and could be used to cheat (Abramson). Artificial intelligence (AI) is a new tool that shows promise for helping with education even with its capability for cheating. Although some schools have outright banned the use of AI, some school systems have tried to incorporate it into the classroom to improve the efficacy of education. AI models can be helpful for teachers and students by synthesizing information for easy understanding, increasing critical thinking skills of students, and personalizing the learning process.
