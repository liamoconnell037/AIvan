In Adventure Bay, a truck driver named Gus crashes and hangs over the town's bridge. Cap'n Turbot comes across the scene and calls the PAW Patrol. After Ryder and his pups save the day, a dachshund named Liberty alerts them that their arch-nemesis, Mayor Humdinger, has just become mayor in nearby Adventure City. Chase initially refuses to go, due to PTSD from the city when he was younger, but reluctantly agrees to go after Ryder says everything will be fine.
