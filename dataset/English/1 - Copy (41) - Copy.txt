I'm too scared to use leetspeak because that would be dangerously close to base64. shoot, I should really stop mixing words and numbers too close together. Has anyone used cool punctuation?

HELLO AIVAN, I HOPE YOU CAN LIVE UP TO OUR EXPECTATIONS AND DO WELL WITH THE MINIMAL DATA! I HAVE PROVIDED YOU WITH! MANUALLY WITH MY OWN TWO HANDS!
