IAIN ARMITAGE AS CHASE, AN AMBITIOUS 7-YEAR-OLD GERMAN SHEPHERD IS THE MAIN PROTAGONIST OF THE MOVIE WHO SERVES AS A POLICE PUP. HE GREW UP ON THE STREETS OF ADVENTURE CITY, GIVING HIM A "STRONG CHARACTER ARC FOR THE FILM". ARMITAGE FOUND THE ROLE SPECIAL AND ENJOYABLE. HE SAID, "IT'S A NEW CHALLENGE BECAUSE YOU DON'T GET TO CONVEY ANYTHING WITH YOUR BODY MOVEMENTSâ€¦ THAT'S ALL THE ANIMATOR'S JOB," HE THEN EXPLAINED: "YOU CAN ONLY USE YOUR VOICE TO CONVEY WHATEVER YOU'RE TRYING TO SHOW. BUT IT'S REALLY FUN TO DO ANIMATION." ARMITAGE REPLACES JUSTIN KELLY FROM THE SERIES.
