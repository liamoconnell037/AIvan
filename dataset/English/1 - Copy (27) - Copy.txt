The intense focus on math class, specifically before college, is commonly attributed to the undeniable weight of standardized tests on a student’s college admissions and a school’s rankings and budget. When discussing the issues with modern math classes on his podcast, Stephen Dubner addresses these external factors: “One of the strongest incentives is the high-stakes testing done in almost every state. How students perform on these tests can determine school funding, teacher bonuses, whether a principal is fired, and even whether a school will be shut down” (Dubner 2019). While it is becoming increasingly more common for colleges to go ‘test-optional’ for admissions, the quality of schools, no matter what grade level, is determined almost entirely by standardized testing scores. Even within schools, teachers who’s classes get higher scores are often treated better and have more freedom then their coworkers. This test score mentality doesn’t just bleed into classrooms, but into students as well. Students, especially highschoolers, aren’t taught to understand math, they are taught to understand math tests. They are taught to understand the ‘correct’ way to solve problems, with the ‘correct’ way being determined by the way it’s done on standardized tests, or whatever is faster, which is more effective for standardized tests. Ironically enough, even David Coleman, CEO of College Board, and a major contributor to the SAT, speaks about the pressure that teachers face to teach their students so much math: “They must do everything, or they are betraying their kids, which forced them to race through the curriculum lest their kids are not ready. What college teachers say but is not heard is, ‘if your students can do these core set of things, we can do the rest’” (qtd. in Dubner 2019). This pressure to make math a competition has caused the education system to cut so many corners, that they may have even cut out the math itself.
