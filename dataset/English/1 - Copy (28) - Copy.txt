Through this research, it became evident that even though the problems with math curriculums are so obvious, they are so deeply rooted in every aspect of education that changing math class would require a complete redesign of the American education system. Small issues like memorization unfold into complex problems like the abstraction of math, and even those problems are just a product of school environments and the external pressure that is the value of standardized test scores and academic competition. Just like a complex math equation, something that appears to be short and simple on its face quickly opens an endless rabbit hole so deeply entwined with everything else in society that it becomes impossible to understand it fully. Fixing math will be a bigger problem than most people realize, and while it may not have a formula, it is a problem that can be solved.
