One of the main focal points that AI language models have is the ability to mold knowledge into more digestible information. ChatGPT, which is developed by OpenAI, is one of the language models with that ability. ChatGPT was trained on, or taught by, human-written data from the internet so it could create its answers (“What is ChatGPT?”). AI language models excel at synthesizing the data that they were trained on into easier to understand information that any user can learn from. This is perfect for schools, as it would become much easier for students to understand and learn material if it was explained by an AI. For example, if a student is having difficulty understanding their homework, they might just look up the answers and continue to not understand. However, with AI, that student could instead get synthesized information that teaches them the information so they succeed in the future. Even in the classroom
