THIS IS STILL A SET OF FUNCTIONING ENGLISH WORDS EVEN THOUGH THE LETTERS ARE CAPITALIZED. A LESSON I HAVE PREVIOSULY NEGLECTED AND WITH PROCEED TO NEGLECT FURTHER DUE TO ITS RELATIVE INCONVINIENCE. AS YOU MAY ALREADY INFER, THERE ARE NO WIKIPEDIA ARTICLES OR RESEARCH PAPERS WRITTEN IN EXCLUSIVELY CAPITAL LETTERS, AND WHILE I COULD JUST COPY AND PASTE THEM INTO A WEBSITE THAT WOULD CAPITALIZE THEM FOR ME, I AM LAZY. DUE TO THIS EXTERNAL FACTOR, I WILL TYPE OUT CAPITAL LETTER PLAIN ENGLISH SAMPLES ON MY OWN AS IT WILL BE CRUCIAL FOR THE LOOPING SOLVE STRATEGY THAT I HAVE IN MIND. HOWEVER, SAID STRATEGY WILL REQUIRE AND EXCRUCIATINGLY PAINFULL AMOUNT OF OUTSIDE DATA AND REASORCES FOR REASONABLE ACCURACY AS WE WOULD HAVE TO DEVELOP SOMETHING AKIN TO A FRACTION OF THE ENGLISH COMPREHENSION OF CHAT GPT, SOMETHING WE ARE LIKELY NOT CAPABLE OF WITHOUT SIGNIFICANT OUTSIDE HELP.
